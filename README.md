# -todolistprojectcrud-front-end
### ToDo List

This project was created with the main purpose of learning MongoDB database  and understand how the connection between back-end and front end works. Front-end was created with ReactJs.

For this project in the back-end side I followed a MongoDB tutorial shared in MongoDB page. (**see links to tutorial bellow**).

For the development of the proyect in the front-end side I used CSS vanilla  and Reactjs, Bootstrap Icons and SweetAlert2 for delete alert.

The deploy for back-end was made in Heroku and the deployment for the entire programm was made with Netlify. (**se link to deployment page bellow**).


Also I checked the API connections wtih Postman App and the database structured with MongoDB Compass, (**see links to tutorial bellow**).

This has been such an amazing and enriching project as I now understand how the back-end and front-end connection works and the whole behind-the-scenes process of creating a dynamic website. Thanks to the people who helped me through the process.
